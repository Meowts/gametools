This project is dead, though fun while it lasted. It's a framework for creating point-and-click games using Phaser 2.

I've now moved on to using Phaser 3, which, using ES6 syntax, removes a lot of the need for abstraction I created here.

Check out [berth](https://github.com/coleman-benjamin/berth) for my latest approach, leveraging Phaser 3 and webpack.
