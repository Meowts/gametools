# toolps

Starting to build a collection of tools/prototypes for creating games with the Phaser game framework.

Pretty basic stuff so far as I'm just beginning to play around with game dev, but I'm trying to structure it in a way that will be helpful down the road, and to build modules that can be very data driven.

This will be a long work in progress :)
